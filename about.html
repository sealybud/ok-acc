    <p><b>What is this website?</b></p>
    <p>This site is just to figure out what I actually want to put on here, and as of right now there's a lotta random stuff which explains why.
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><b>When was this created?</b></p>
    <p>I made this website in February 2025, on the 23rd, and then I didn't touch it for months until July 9 when I realized that I wasn't actually coding 
        on Linux Mint (VBox) as much as I had been between February and July.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>What's this site published with?</b></p>
    <p>I published it using Github which is in the url, but soon if I change this site and add way more things on it then I'm def going to
        change the domain and stuff like that.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>How can I help?</b></p>
    <p>You can give me ideas on what to put here, and/or donate me 10 robux which is the button you click on the right at the top of every page, and if you do,
        дякую 🤑🤑🙏🙏
